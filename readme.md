## About The Project

![Game preview](https://i.imgur.com/5ecNmAp.png)

This is the repository of a school project aiming at creating the game Terraria which is a sandbox game in two dimensions. We could describe it as Minecraft in two dimensions. The game has a lot of features but we are not going to discuss them here. I'm not going to keep working on this project but feel free to make any contribution !

### Built With

The requirements for this school project were to use Java and Swing was used to create the user interface for the game.
I provided a long report about the architecture of the game and the development process but it's in french.

## Getting Started

To play the game you can clone this repository using :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

Then you can run the game using the following command :

```sh
java -jar Project-Name.jar
```

### Controls

Since this project was aiming at recreating the game Terraria, I decided to use the same controls as the game that were intuitive. I'll let you explore your keyboard to discover the controls ! There is no way to customize the controls of the game right now but feel free to change the code or add a way to customize the controls by submitting a pull request !
